These are just my own project notes, to help keep track of what needs to be fixed/added/worked own

1. Streamline page routing and navbar--we dont need the order online button to go to the cart if theres already a cart icon in the navbar in the first place.  Either remove the button or have it take you to the menu
    Idea actually..Take the current /menu, move it to /order, build on that-replace /menu with a more static page that simply shows a view of the current physical menu but converted into an easier to read version.  Easy on mobile as well-IMPORTANT




2. Just testing needs to be done.  Need to test every feature of the website still

3. Need to get site photos imported.  Site needs to be hauled with real text on each info page with words from the store owners

4. Update the ordering menu a bit with styling.  I feel like its too cumbersome to have such few number of category tabs
    IDEA- have category sub dropdowns like in lunch dishes you might have different drop downs for differnt chicken dishes, or steak dishes, etc..
        Need to look at actual menu to determin if this is even a real issue.



5. Would love to have external testing from people that arent involved in the website



6, just make sure everything shows up in the database and can be easily manipulated from there with the POS system

7.  Need to actuall remove all hints of delivery service provided by the store.  Store does not offer direct delivery, only through ubereats etc

8. Possible restructure of order tracking
